    "message": "Welcome! I’m Alejandra López, a linguist, teacher, and founder of Grama Spanish. This project was born from my passion for teaching Spanish to people from different places and cultures. At our school, we don’t follow a single methodology because we believe there isn’t just one way to learn. That’s why we adapt to each student’s needs, interests, and learning style, ensuring a dynamic, effective, and motivating experience. Whether you want to improve your Spanish for travel, work, or simply to enjoy the language, we are here to guide you with classes designed especially for you. Learning Spanish can be a unique and enriching experience! Are you ready to start with us?"
